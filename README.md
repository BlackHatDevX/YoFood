# YoFood - Food Ordering App

YoFood is a food ordering app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to browse through a variety of food items, add them to their cart, and place orders for delivery. The app showcases various features of a food ordering platform and demonstrates the integration of a frontend React application with a backend API.
